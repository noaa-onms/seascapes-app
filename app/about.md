Seascapes are dynamic classifications of water masses based on sea surface properties derived from satellite imagery.

This Seascapes app was designed to help nodes in the [MarineBON.org](https://marinebon.org) network extract Seascape data, especially across [NOAA Sanctuaries](https://sanctuaries.noaa.gov), for comparison with biological data from eDNA, sound, telemetry and other observational data to evaluate how dynamic water masses relate to ecosystem function.
